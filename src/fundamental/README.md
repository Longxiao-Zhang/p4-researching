# Scenario

* Learning how to write a P4 program by [basic example](basic).
* Learning how to make a P4Runtime controller(I called it simple-monitor) by [simple example](imple-monitor).
* Learning how to use a P4Runtime controller:
    * From [example of p4lang/tutorials - p4runtime](advance-tunnel).
    * From [advance usage(larger topo, modify/delete table entries support) of controller](advance-topo).
* Learning how to use [In-band Network Telemetry (`WIP`)](int)
    * Using `psa.p4`(Can't compiled)/`v1model.p4`(Compiled, but not tested) architecture to construct transit/sink target device.
* Learning how to implement NAT 
    * Simple NAT forward/reverse [example](simple-nat)
    * More complicated (`WIP`)
* Learning how to implement MPLS
    * MPLS [example](mpls) (Not standard MPLS)
* Learning how to implement broadcast 
    * bcast [example](bcast)
* Learning how to use register
    * register [example](register)
    * table-array [example](table-array)
* Learning how to use meter
    * meter [example](meter)
